# weatherAssistent
This application was developed on my secound year studing computing science, it is a chatbot weather assistent using API to receive the data
the assigment: develop a chatbot using API to retrive the data about the weather in a city in the world.
This chabot using in java using jframe and 2 API to retrive the information about weather in any city in the world.
For this project using jframe the user is asking about waht country and city he wants to know the temperature.
A free api from (https://geocode.maps.co) was used to find the geolocation (latitute and longitute) from a city.
Using the geolocation another API from (https://open-meteo.com) was used to retrive details about the weather such as temperature, max temperature, min temperature etc.
Audio was added into the chatbot to make it more challenging.
This project used two API because was the only free API option available that I could find.
Before this project my knowledge about API, Jframe and Audio in Java was zero, i've learn from scratch and applyed in a "short" period.

programing code: Java 
technology: API, java fx, gitHub, Json
